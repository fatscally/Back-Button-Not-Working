Use the buttons on the pages to move forward from Page1 -> Page2 -> Page3 -> Page4 -> Page5.  
Use the Back Button in the top left to go backwards.  It should work as expected.

Bug?  
Use the menu to select Page2.  Now again navigate forward P3 -> P4 -> P5.   From P4 the Back Button or Back Navigation won't work?!
